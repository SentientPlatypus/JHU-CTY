# Self Reflection

### Overall Performance
I performed well in the class. I always did my best work, and tried my best to keep the assignments organized. I keep all the writeups in a github repository, and do my best to turn in high quality work. Everything in this repository was turned in.

### Content Proficiency
I understand all the concepts presented during this class. I ensure my understanding by asking good questiong, and doing all the calculations. I worked hard, and wrote most of the writeups in a notebook. 

### Laboratory Skills
I made sure to read each part of the labs and report the results thoroughly, and analyze them thoughtfully. 

### Collaboration and Participation
I work with my peers very well. Secifically Akul and Jayden. Jayden and I cooked really hard on the engineering innovation project for anti-texting and driving mechanisms.

### SUggestions an Recommendations
I would recommend more time to work, so that we could actually pursue our engineering innovation project and make better prototypes.
