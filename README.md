Throughout the 3 week course, we completed lots of labs, and projects, with each of them documented here. I chose to do most of my writeups in notebooks, as it seemed like a great tool when working with datasets and calculations. I tried R, but Im better with np and pandas haha.

Check it out. CTY is fun
