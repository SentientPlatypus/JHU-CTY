# Origami

> Think about the use of origami tessellations and the structure of the origami box. Write one paragraph about an object you use frequently that could benefit from an origami design. Explain how it would benefit from origami design

Tesselations are patterns that are copy-pasted together. This means that we could find applications in objects that have repeated features, rectangular or circular patterns. An application that immediately comes to mind is a pencil holder for a desk. THere could be repeated indents that could keep pencils from rolling off the desk or into a certain area. An origami design with a malleable material would be more resistant to trauma.
